# Autonomous Drone / Wireless Server
[Base 11](http://www.base11.com/programs/fellowships/?dzsvg_startitem_dzs-video0=0) Autonomous Systems Engineering Academy Program
Created an Quadcopter that utilizes both an Arduino and Raspberry Pi to autonomously gather altitude data</br>
as well as act as a wireless server.

A proof of concept of distributing network capabilities to areas where it's difficult to establish networking infastructure.
